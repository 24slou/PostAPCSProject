This document will illustrate examples of markdown notation for provide clear and effective communication.

We can impact the size of text by using heading values:

\# Heading 1

# Heading 1

\#\# Heading 2

## Heading 2

\#\#\# Heading 3

### Heading 3

We can also impact the style of our text:

\* italic \* becomes *italic*

\** bold \**  becomes  **bold**

\> We can set off text in blockquotes:

> We can set off text in blockquotes

Next, we will look at lists.  These can be ordered, which uses simple numbers:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

or, unordered lists, which utilize \- to start lists:

- some item
- another item


alternatively, you can use \- \[ ] to build checklists:

- [ ] Checklist 1
- [ ] Checklist 2
- [x] Checklist 3

The last item in the checklist was created with \- \[x].

We can also represent code segments in markdown using \``` java:

``` java
if( k > 3 ){
  return k - 4; 
}
```

We can summarize this in a table:

Symbol | Result
-------|---------
\* italic \* | *italic*
\** bold \** | **bold**
\-[ ] checklist |
\-[x] completed check |
\> blockquote |
\``` java |
